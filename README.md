# RSLib
A collection of scripts and shaders written or found and used over the years.
Includes editor tools, utility components, algorithms such as A* or Poisson disc sampling, easing functions, etc.
All of the library content is made to usable in any Unity project, although the Miscellaneous folder contains stuff that could be used but is either WIP or very specific.
